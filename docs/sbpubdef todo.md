- **SPFx forms**  
    - there's a LOT of forms we can turn into SPFx webparts:

# landing-redirect-ext todo  
- [x] create groups on Entra (on my .[sharepoint.com](http://sharepoint.com))  
    - [x] attorney  
    - [x] hr  
- [x] copy group id's (from entra id (no access??? can (at least) grab logged in user groups in spfx w/ graph api))    â€”into landing-redirect-ext manifest.json ***redirectRules*** property  
- [x] graph api:  redirectTarget now points to  /sites/x based on groups (w/ my .[sharepoint.com](http://sharepoint.com))  
        * **currently it just logs: ** redirectRules, logged in user groups, redirectionTarget (and it works)  
- [ ] figure out deploying on my .[sharepoint.com](http://sharepoint.com)  
    - [ ] ...  
- [ ] verify that it works on [countyofsb.sharepoint.com](http://countyofsb.sharepoint.com): (**++can't++** until they create security groups & share the object id's from Entra)  
    - [ ] deploy: upload app/solution, bundle to AppCatalog/ClientSideAssets, etc.  
  
hint: see *docs/laptop notes.md *for group ids/names
